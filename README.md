## Installing Nix (and direnv)

> :information_source: If you already have NixOS installed, just skip ahead.

The preffered way to install system dependencies is to use Nix. If you are feeling bold, a good way to install NixOS is to us the installer as provided by Determinate Systems, read more [here](https://determinate.systems/posts/determinate-nix-installer)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

For `direnv` the easiest way is probably still to use `brew` and install it using a simple `brew install direnv`. Also add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```
